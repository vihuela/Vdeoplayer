1
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,790
{\an2}我相信美国
I believe in America.

2
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,140
{\an2}美国使我发了财
America has made my fortune...

3
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,860
{\an2}而我以美国方式教养我的女儿
and I raised my daughter in the American fashion.

4
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,830
{\an2}我给她自由
I give her freedom,

5
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,110
{\an2}但也告诉她永远不要有辱家门
but I taught her never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,120
{\an2}她交了位男友但不是意大利人
She found a boyfriend. Not an Italian.

7
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,710
{\an2}她跟他去看电影  深夜才回家
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,530
{\an2}我并没有责骂她
She stayed out late. I didn't protest.

9
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,890
{\an2}两个月前他与另一个男孩
Two months ago, he took her for a drive...

10
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,190
{\an2}带她去兜风
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,220
{\an2}他们强灌她喝威士忌
They made her drink whiskey...

12
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,570
{\an2}然后他们想要占她便宜
and then they tried to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,510
{\an2}她抵抗  她保住了名节
She resisted.She kept her honor.

14
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,980
{\an2}于是他们像对动物般的毒打她
So they beat her like an animal.

15
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,840
{\an2}当我到医院时  她的鼻梁断了
When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken...

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,110
{\an2}她的下巴被打碎了
her jaw was shattered...

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,270
{\an2}必须用钢丝绑着才不会掉下来
held together by wire.

18
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,440
{\an2}她痛得不能哭
She couldn't even weep because of the pain.

19
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,520
{\an2}但我却哭了  我为什么哭呢?
But I wept. Why did I weep?

20
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,730
{\an2}我视她如珠如宝
She was the light of my life.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,860
{\an2}她长得很美丽
Beautiful girl.

22
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,370
{\an2}现在她再也美丽不起来
Now she will never be beautiful again.

23
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,400
{\an2}不好意思
Sorry.

24
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,740
{\an2}我…像个守法的美国人一样  我去报警
I went to the police like a good American.

25
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,770
{\an2}那两个男孩受到了审判
These two boys were brought to trial.

26
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,290
{\an2}法官判他们有期徒刑三年但缓刑
Ajudge sentence them to three years in prison...and suspend their sentence.

27
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,680
{\an2}缓刑
Suspended sentence.

28
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,020
{\an2}他们当天就没事了
They went free that very day.

29
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,670
{\an2}我像个傻瓜似的站在法庭中
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

30
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840
{\an2}而那两个混蛋竟朝着我笑
And those two bastard, they smiled at me.

31
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,340
{\an2}于是我对我太太说
Then I said to my wife,

32
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,220
{\an2}为求公道 我们必须去找柯里昂阁下
"For justice we must go to Don Corleone."

33
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,290
{\an2}你去报警前为何不先来找我
Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

34
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,860
{\an2}你要我怎么样
What do you want of me?

35
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,930
{\an2}你尽管吩咐  但求你一定要帮我这个忙
Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do.

36
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,930
{\an2}帮你什么忙
What is that?

37
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,420
{\an2}那个我办不到
That I cannot do.

38
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,500
{\an2}你要什么  我都会给你
I'll give you anything you ask.

39
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,800
{\an2}我们相识多年
We've known each other many years,

40
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,100
{\an2}这是你第一次来找我帮忙
but this is the first time you ever came to me for counsel or for help.

41
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,270
{\an2}我记不起你上次是何时  请我到你家去喝咖啡了
I can't remember the last time that you invited me... to your house for a cup of coffee...

42
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,040
{\an2}何况我太太还是你独生女的教母
even though my wife is godmother to your only child.

43
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,480
{\an2}我坦白说吧
But let's be frank.

44
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,950
{\an2}你从来就不想要我的友谊
You never wanted my friendship...

45
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,170
{\an2}而且你害怕欠我人情
and you were afraid to be in my debt.

46
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,850
{\an2}我不想卷入是非
I didn't want to get into trouble.

47
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,590
{\an2}我了解
I understand.

48
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,580
{\an2}你在美国发了财
You found paradise in America.

49
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,590
{\an2}生意做的很好  生活过的很好
You had a good trade, made a good living.

50
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,710
{\an2}有警察和法律保护你
Police protected you, and there were courts of law.

51
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,250
{\an2}你不需要我这种朋友
So you didn't need a friend like me.

52
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,250
{\an2}但是现在你来找我说
But now you come to me and you say...

53
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,470
{\an2}柯里昂阁下  请帮我主持公道
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

54
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,730
{\an2}但你对我一点尊重也没有
But you don't ask with respect.

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,330
{\an2}你并不把我当朋友
You don't offer friendship.

56
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,370
{\an2}你甚至不愿意喊我教父
You don't even think to call me "Godfather."

57
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,400
{\an2}你在我女儿结婚当天来我家
Instead, you come into my house... on the day my daughter is to be married...

58
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,150
{\an2}用钱收买我为你杀人
and you ask me to do murder for money.

59
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,970
{\an2}我只是要求你主持公道
I ask you for justice.

60
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,220
{\an2}那不是公道  你女儿还活着
That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive.

61
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,300
{\an2}那么让他们像她一样受折磨
They must suffer then as she suffers.

62
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,470
{\an2}我应该付你多少钱
How much shall I pay you?

63
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,460
{\an2}包纳萨拉  包纳萨拉
Bonasera Bonasera.

64
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,820
{\an2}到底我做了什么让你这么的不尊重我
What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?

65
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,350
{\an2}如果你以朋友身分来找我
If you'd come to me in friendship...

66
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,260
{\an2}那么伤害你女儿的杂碎  就会受到折磨
then the scum that ruined your daughter...would be suffering this very day.

67
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,830
{\an2}你这种诚实人的敌人
And if, by chance... an honest man like yourself should make enemies...

68
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,900
{\an2}也就是我的敌人
then they would become my enemies.

69
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,770
{\an2}那么  他们就会害怕你
And then they would fear you.

70
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,370
{\an2}当我的朋友
Be my friend?

71
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,480
{\an2}教父

72
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,080
{\an2}很好
Good.

73
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,910
{\an2}他日我或许需要你的帮忙
Someday, and that day may never come...

74
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,490
{\an2}也可能不会有那么一天
I'll call upon you to do a service for me.

75
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,510
{\an2}但在那一天到来之前
But until that day...

76
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,060
{\an2}收下这份公道做为小女结婚之礼
accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.

77
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,490
{\an2}谢谢  教父  别客气
Grazie, Godfather.

78
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,610
{\an2}这件事交给…  克里曼沙
Give this to Clemenza.

79
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,980
{\an2}我要用可靠的人头脑清醒的人
I want reliable people... people that aren't going to be carried away.

80
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,970
{\an2}我们不是谋杀犯  下手别太重
I mean, we're not murderers... in spite of what this undertaker says.

81
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,510
{\an2}麦克在哪?  别担心  他一会就来
-Where's Michael?-What? Don't worry. It's early. He'll be here.

82
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,680
{\an2}没有麦克我不照相
We're not taking it.

83
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,940
{\an2}待会再拍
We're not taking the picture without Michael.

84
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,960
{\an2}什么事?  麦克的事

You look "terrif" on the floor. What are you, a dance judge or something?

{\an2}闪开吧  到附近晃晃做你的工作
Go take a walk around the neighborhood. Do your job.

287
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,120

Why didn't you say you worked for Corleone, Tom?

288
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,730
{\an2}我以为你只是个市井流氓
I thought you were just some cheap, two-bit hustler...

289
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,080
{\an2}是强尼派来勒索我的
Johnny was running in, trying to bluff me.

{\an2}除非真的必要 否则我不想提起他的名字
I don't like to use his name unless it's really necessary.

291

I respect that.

303
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,530
{\an2}告诉他除了这件事
Just tell him he should ask me anything else.

00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,880
{\an2}我什么都答应

{\an2}他被拒绝一次后 不会再要求第二次
He never asks a second favor when he's been refused the first.

306

{\an2}你不了解强尼方亭 永远别想演那部电影
- Understood? - You don't understand.Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

307

313
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,750
{\an2}歌唱课、表演课、跳舞课

314
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,960
{\an2}我在她身上投资了无数的金钱

{\an2}我要让她成为一位巨星
I was gonna make her a big star.

316
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,120
{\an2}让我更坦白的告诉你
And let me be even more frank.

317
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,480
{\an2}让你知道我不是铁石心肠 也不是势利眼
Just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man...that it's not all dollars and cents.

318
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,120
{\an2}她年轻漂亮  天真无邪
She was beautiful. She was young, she was innocent!

319
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,620
{\an2}我拥有她就等于拥有全世界
She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had...and I've had 'em all over the world!

320
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,720
{\an2}然后强尼方亭出现了
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

321
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,930
{\an2}带着磁性的嗓音 加上意大利的魅力
with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.

322
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,050
{\an2}把她拐走了
And she runs off.

323
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,820
{\an2}她跑掉了使我非常难堪
She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous...

324
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:11,350
{\an2}而我这种地位的人无法忍受难堪
and a man in my position can't afford...to be made to look ridiculous!

325
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,780
{\an2}你马上给我滚
Now you get the hell outta here!

326
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,560
{\an2}若是那混球想对我动粗
And if that goombah tries any rough stuff...

327
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,070
{\an2}你告诉他我不是乐队领班
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

328
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,070
{\an2}我听过那个故事了
Yeah. I heard that story.

329
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,750
{\an2}谢谢你的晚餐款待

{\an2}也许你能派车送我去机场

331
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,960
{\an2}柯里昂先生坚持 坏消息要立刻回报
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news immediately.

332

- You're not too tired, Tom? - No, I slept on the plane.

333
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,930
{\an2}我这里有索洛佐的资料
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

334
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:40,190
{\an2}众人皆知  索洛佐是土耳其人
Now... Sollozzo is known as"The Turk."

335
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,680
{\an2}他应该善于用刀
He's supposed to be very good with a knife...

336
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,880
{\an2}但只有发生利益冲突时才会使用
but only in matters of business... with some sort of reasonable complaint.

337
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,960
{\an2}他是做毒品生意的
his business is narcotics.

338
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,740
{\an2}他们在土耳其种罂粟
he has fields in Turkey where they grow the poppy...

339
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,510
{\an2}在西西里有工厂提炼成海洛因
and in Sicily he has the plants to process them into heroin.

340
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,770
{\an2}他需要现金
Now, he needs cash

341
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:03,640
{\an2}以及在毒品交易时 需要警方的保护
and he needs protection from the police for which he gives a piece of the action.

342
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,550
{\an2}我无法查出保护费价钱多少
I couldn't find out how much.

343
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,500
{\an2}在纽约是塔托里亚家族 在保护他
The Tattaglia family is behind him here in New York.

344
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,510
{\an2}他们一定也想分占利益
Now, they have to be in it for something.

345
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,940
{\an2}桑尼柯里昂
Santino Corleone.

346
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,220
{\an2}他的犯罪前科呢? 一次在意大利  一次在这
What about his prison record?Two terms, one in Italy, one here.

{\an2}他是众所周知的大毒枭
He's known as a top narcotics man.

348
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,180
{\an2}桑提诺  你认为呢
Santino, what do you think?

349
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,000
{\an2}白粉可以赚大钱
There's a lot of money in that white powder.

350
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,260
{\an2}我赞成
Tom? I say, yes,

351
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,260
{\an2}毒品比什么都好赚
there's more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking at.

352
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,940
{\an2}就算我们不加入  别人也会
If we don't get into it, somebody else will.

353
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,290
{\an2}也许是五大家族之也许全部都会
Maybe one of the five families, maybe all of them.

354
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,810
{\an2}他们会用毒品赚到的钱 买通警方和政客
With the money they earn... they can buy more police and political power.

355
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,580
{\an2}到时就会赶上我们
Then they come after us.

356
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,770
{\an2}现在我们掌握了工会及赌场
Now we have the unions, we have the gambling...

357
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,460
{\an2}而他们却掌握未来最好的东西 毒品
and they're the best things to have, but narcotics...is a thing of the future.

358
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,110
{\an2}我们若不能分一杯羹
If we don't get a piece of that action...

359
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,450
{\an2}我们可能会失去一切
we risk everything we have.

360
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,390
{\an2}我不是指现在而是在十年之内
Not now, but ten years from now.

361

{\an2}我需要你手中掌握的政客
I need, Don Corleone, those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like so many nickels and dimes.

366
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,220
{\an2}- 对我家族有什么利益? - 三成
- What is the interest for my family? - Thirty percent.

367
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,250

368
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,300
{\an2}然后还会增加
And then it would go up.

369
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,690
{\an2}塔托里亚家族 会得到什么好处?
And what is the interest for the Tattaglia family?

371
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,020
{\an2}我会从我那一份当中分给他们
I'll take care of the Tattaglias outta my share.

372
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:58,750
{\an2}我提供财务、政治和法律的保护 可以分到三成
So, I receive 30% for finance...political influence and legal protection.

373
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,520
{\an2}没错
- That's what you're telling me. - That's right.

374
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,360
{\an2}你为何来找我
Why do you come to me?

375
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,790
{\an2}我为何值得你这么慷慨
Why do I deserve this generosity?

376
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,030
{\an2}若你能考虑投资一百万元现金
If you consider a million dollars in cash...just "finance"...

377
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,900
{\an2}我就会向你敬礼  柯里昂阁下
te salud, Don Corleone.

378
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:29,290
{\an2}我肯见你是因为 我听说你是个正直的人
I said that I would see you because...I heard that you were a serious man...

379
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,620
{\an2}所以我以礼相待
to be treated with respect.

380
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,170
{\an2}但是我必须拒绝你
But I must say no to you.

381
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,940
{\an2}我会告诉你原因
And I'll give you my reason.

382
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,850
{\an2}没错  我是有很多政界的朋友
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

383
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,600
{\an2}但若他们知道我在搞毒品生意 而不再是赌博时
But they wouldn't be friendly very long...

384
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,290
{\an2}他们就不再是我的朋友
if they knew my business was drugs instead of gambling...

385
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,930
{\an2}他们认为赌博 只是些无伤大雅的事业
which they regard as a harmless vice.

386
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,070
{\an2}但毒品是败坏德性的生意
- But drugs is a dirty business.

387
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,800
{\an2}但是柯里昂阁下… 对我而言一个人以何为生
- No, Don Corleone...It doesn't make any difference to me...

388
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,710
{\an2}并没有什么差别
what a man does for a living, you understand...

389
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:08,280
{\an2}但你这种生意…有一点危险性
but your business is...a little dangerous.

390
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,050
{\an2}若你还是担心安全的问题
If you're worried about security for your million...

391
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,870
{\an2}塔托里亚会做保证的
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

392
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,900
{\an2}你是说塔托里亚家族 会保证我们的投资…
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias guarantee our investment...

393
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,160
{\an2}等一下
Wait a minute.

394
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:28,280
{\an2}你看我把孩子都给宠坏了
I have a sentimental weakness for my children...and I spoil them, as you can see.

395
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,450
{\an2}他们说话非常没有分寸
They talk when they should listen.

396
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,060
{\an2}但总之  索洛佐先生
But anyway Signor Sollozzo

397
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,320
{\an2}我的决定还是不行
my "no" is final...

398
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,460
{\an2}我要恭喜你的生意
and I wish to congratulate you on your new business.

399
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,930
{\an2}我知道你会很成功我祝你好运
I know you'll do very well, and good luck to you...

400
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,040
{\an2}尤其是你的生意不会与我的冲突
especially since your interests don't conflict with mine.

401
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,820
{\an2}谢谢
Thank you.

402
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,090

{\an2}你是怎么回事
What's the matter with you?

405

{\an2}我看你和女孩子胡搞之后 脑子退化了
I think your brain is going soft...from all that comedy you're playing with that young girl.

{\an2}上面没说他是死是活
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

468
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,770
{\an2}他伤的很重  麦克

469
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:40,650
{\an2}你还在吗? 是的  我在这

{\an2}你是怎么回事? 桑尼  别激动
Shut your mouth. What's the matter with you?Jesus Christ! Take it easy.

{\an2}保利在哪?

- How many times he been sick? - Only maybe three, four times.

482
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,950
{\an2}弗雷多并不想另找保镳 马上接他来
I asked Freddy if he wants a different bodyguard.

483
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,560
{\an2}我不管他病的有多重
- He said no. - Pick him up now.I don't care how sick he is.

484
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,560
{\an2}只要他还在呼吸 我要你把他带到家父的房子去
If he's breathin', I want you to bring him to my father's house now.

485
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,120

487
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,410

{\an2}我会派几个人到家里来
All right.I'm havin' a couple of our people come to the house.

{\an2}约三小时后我们会释放他
In about three hours, he'll be released with our proposition.

492
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,380
{\an2}在你做任何事之前 先听听他说的话
Listen to everything he has to say before you do anything.

493
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,080
{\an2}木己成舟
What's done is done.

494
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:22,160
{\an2}先别发怒  好吗?桑尼
And don't lose that famous temper of yours, huh, Sonny?

495
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,840
{\an2}不会的  我会等
No, I'll wait.

496
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,220
{\an2}你的老板死了
Your boss is dead.

497
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,530
{\an2}我知道你在家族中是不喜欢动武
I know you're not in the muscle end of the family...

498
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,520
{\an2}所以我不想要你感到害怕
so I don't want you to be scared.

499
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:53,160
{\an2}我要你帮助柯里昂还有帮我
I want you to help the Corleones...and I want you to help me.

500
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,030
{\an2}接了你约一小时后
We got him outside his office...

501
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,020
{\an2}我们己在他办公室外干掉他了
about an hour after we picked you up.

502
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,930
{\an2}喝吧
Drink it.

503
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,180
{\an2}现在全看你的了,让我与桑尼和平解决一切
So now it's up to you to make the peace between me and Sonny.

504
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,560
{\an2}桑尼对我的主意很热衷 不是吗?
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

505
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,600
{\an2}而且你知道那么做是对的
And you knew it was the right thing to do.

506
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,930
{\an2}桑尼会不惜一切的来追杀你
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.

507
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,200
{\an2}那会是他的第一个反应
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

508
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,230
{\an2}所以要你去劝劝他
That's why you gotta talk some sense into him.

509
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:37,230
{\an2}塔托里亚家族全力支持我
The Tattaglia family is behind me with all their people.

510
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,130
{\an2}纽约其它的家族
The other New York families

511
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:42,130
{\an2}也会不惜一切防止全面的战争
will go along with anything...that will prevent a full-scale war.

512
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:43,800
{\an2}让我们面对现实吧  汤姆
Let's face it,

513
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,150
{\an2}我们全都尊敬他
in all due respect...

514
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,040
{\an2}但教父己今非昔比 愿他安息
the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

515
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,940
{\an2}十年前我能对付他吗?
Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him?

516
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,690
{\an2}但现在他已经死了
Well, now he's dead.

517
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,990
{\an2}他死了  汤姆
He's dead,Tom.

518
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,200
{\an2}没什么能让他复生
and nothing can bring him back.

519
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,580
{\an2}所以你得和桑尼谈谈
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

520
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,230
{\an2}也得说服两个大头目 泰西欧及肥克里曼沙
You gotta talk to the caporegimes... that Tessio, that fat Clemenza.

521
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,470
{\an2}那是笔好生意  汤姆
It's good business, Tom.

522
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,700
{\an2}我试试看
I'll try.

523
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:23,560
{\an2}但即使是桑尼也阻止不了路卡
But even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.

524
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,860
{\an2}这个…路卡让我来担心
Yeah. Well...Let me worry about Luca.

525
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,020
{\an2}你只管说服桑尼
You just talk to Sonny.

526
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,710
{\an2}及他另外两个兄弟
And the other two kids.

527
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:47,780
{\an2}我尽力而为 很好
I'll do my best.Good.

528
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,830
{\an2}现在…你可以走了
Now, you can go.

529
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,770
{\an2}我不喜欢暴力  汤姆 我是个生意人
I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman.

530
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,810
{\an2}流血代价太高了
Blood is a big expense.

531
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,960
{\an2}他还活着
He's still alive.

532
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,340
{\an2}他们打了他五枪  他还活着
They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive!

533
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,910
{\an2}那对我是件坏事
Well, that's bad luck for me...

534
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,240
{\an2}若你不能谈成那档事 对你也不是好事
and bad luck for you if you don't make that deal.

535
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,670
{\an2}令堂在医院陪令尊
Your mother's over in the hospital with your father.

536
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,090
{\an2}看起来他能度遇难关 谢天谢地
Looks like he's gonna pull through, thank God.

537
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:34,160
{\an2}全是塔托里亚家族策划的 你认为如何?
- That's a lot of bad blood. - What do you think?

538
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,870
{\an2}教父认为这是设计好的
It's too far. I think it's too personal.

539
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,100
{\an2}你要把那些人全杀掉? 别插手这件事  麦克
- The Don will consider this over. - You gonna kill all those guys?

540
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:41,990
{\an2}索洛佐是关键 除掉他一切就好办了
-Stay out of it, Mickey.-Sollozzo's the key. You get rid of him, everything falls into line.

541
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,600
{\an2}路卡呢? 索洛佐认为他可以控制路卡
What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.

542
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,420
{\an2}我不知道

{\an2}如果路卡出卖我们 我们就有大麻烦了
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

{\an2}有人能与路卡连络上吗?
Has anyone been able to get in touch with Luca?

545
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,020
{\an2}我试了一整夜但没有人接
We've been tryin' all night. He might be shacked up.

{\an2}麦克  帮我个忙打电话给路卡

551
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,830
{\an2}我们就会失去政界的联系

{\an2}纽约其它的家族 为了避免长期的战争

553
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:18,350
{\an2}可能会联合支持索洛佐

554
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,820
{\an2}现在是一九四六年了

{\an2}你说来容易  那不是你父亲
That's easy for you to say. He's not your father.

00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,340
{\an2}保利  我叫你在外面守着

{\an2}大门的人说收到一包东西
The guy at the gates, they say they got a package.

563

{\an2}是的  我很好
- I'm fine.

567
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,460
{\an2}有点吃的  你饿了吗?
Yeah? There's some food in the icebox. You hungry?

568
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:59,720
{\an2}不  没关系的
- No, it's all right. Thanks.

569
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,490
{\an2}喝杯酒吧 一点白兰地能让你舒服点
- How 'bout a little brandy?- That's good to sweat it out.

570
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,760
{\an2}好吧 去吧  孩子
- Sure.- Go ahead.

571
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,830
{\an2}那或许是个好主意

572
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,880
{\an2}我要你立刻处置那个王八蛋
I want you to take care of that son of a bitch right away.

573
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,580
{\an2}保利出卖了老头  那个混蛋
Paulie sold out the old man.

574
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:12,830
{\an2}我不想再见到他
I don't wanna see him again.

575
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,910
{\an2}这是你第一件先要解决的工作
Make that first thing on your list.

576
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,430
{\an2}明白吗? 明白

00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,380
{\an2}麦克  明天你带几个人

00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,350
{\an2}到路卡的公寓去看看  等他出现
Go to Luca's apartment. Wait for him to show up.

579
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,510
{\an2}也许我们不该让麦克太直接涉入
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike mixed up in this too directly.

580
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:31,060
{\an2}听我说…待在家里接电话 那会有大帮助的
Listen, hang around the house on the phone. It'll be a big help.

581

{\an2}再试着打给路卡
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

582
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,310
{\an2}这是什么? 那是西西里人的口信
- What the hell is this? - It's a Sicilian message.

583
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,330
{\an2}那表示路卡布拉西与鱼同眠了
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

584
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,240
{\an2}我现在要走了 你今晚几点会回家?
- I'm goin' now. - What time you gonna be home?

{\an2}罗可  坐到另一边去

{\an2}他想要跟对手开战了
He's thinkin' of goin' to the mattresses already.

{\an2}我们得在西区找个地方藏匿
We gotta find a spot over on the West Side.

00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,730
{\an2}你试试西四三街三零九号
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

593
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,380
{\an2}你知道西区有何好地方吗? 我想想看
You know any good spots on the West Side? - Yeah, I'll think about it.

594
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,900
{\an2}你开车的时候想想好吗?

600
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,690
{\an2}确定要干净的

601
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,250
{\an2}因为我们要在那待段长时间
Those guys are gonna be stuck up in there for a long time.

00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,640
{\an2}它们是干净的  他们说消毒过
They're clean. They told me they exterminate them.

603
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,640
{\an2}消毒  用那个字很不好

{\an2}消毒  听听这个家伙
Exterminate. Get this guy.

605
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,070
{\an2}小心点  我们才不会为你消毒
See how we don't exterminate you.

606
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,110
{\an2}那真是好笑

{\an2}守家父的人是怎么回事?

{\an2}你马上离开这医院
You get out of here and stay away from this hospital.

-He's a war hero. He's never been busted... -

706
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,750
{\an2}该死的  我说把他带回去

707
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:39,040
{\an2}索洛佐付你多少钱来陷害家父?
What's the Turk paying you to set up my father, Captain?

708

{\an2}把他抓牢  让他站稳

709
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,840
{\an2}我是柯里昂家的律师
I'm the attorney for the Corleone family.

710

{\an2}经过医院的事之后  桑尼气疯了

That Turk shows one hair on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

723
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:31,360

{\an2}那土耳其人想谈判

729
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,220

{\an2}他要我们派麦克去

732
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,410
{\an2}那布鲁诺·塔托里亚呢?
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

733
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:57,980
{\an2}那是条件的一部分
That's part of the deal.

734
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:00,140
{\an2}他作为对家父挨枪的补偿
Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.

735
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,070
{\an2}桑尼  我们该听听他们怎么说

736
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,670
{\an2}不…不再听了  军师
No more. Not this time, Consigliere.

737
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:09,280
{\an2}不再和谈、不再讨论 不再上索洛佐的当
No more meetings, no discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.

738
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:11,310
{\an2}你去跟他们说  我要索洛佐
You give them one message... I want Sollozzo.

739
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,400
{\an2}否则我们就开战
If not, it's all-out war. We go to the mattresses.

740
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,650
{\an2}桑尼  其它家族不会支持的
Some of the other families won't sit still for a war.

741
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,400
{\an2}叫他们把索洛佐交给我
- Then they hand me Sollozzo. - Your father wouldn't like this.

742
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:18,130
{\an2}桑尼  令尊不会喜欢的 这是生意  不能感情用事
- This is business, not personal.

743
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,300
{\an2}那我父亲就该挨枪了
- They shot my father.

744
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,820
{\an2}即使是令尊挨枪也是生意
Even shooting your father was business,

745
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:22,980
{\an2}不是个人的事  桑尼
not personal, Sonny.

746
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,110
{\an2}那生意必须要停  行吗?
Well, then business will have to suffer.

747
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,590
{\an2}听着  帮我个忙  汤姆
And do me a favor, Tom...

748
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,020
{\an2}别再建议我如何让事情过去
No more advice on how to patch things up.

749
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:31,140
{\an2}只要帮我赢  好吗?
Just help me win, please. All right?

750
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,050
{\an2}我查出了打断麦克下巴 那麦克劳斯基队长的事
I found out about this McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.

751
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:41,350
{\an2}他怎么样?
What about him?

752
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,770
{\an2}他肯定在索洛佐的规费名单中 而且是很大一笔钱
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money.

753
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:47,740
{\an2}麦克劳斯基是索洛佐的保镖
McCluskey has agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.

754
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,780
{\an2}你必须要了解  桑尼
What you have to understand, Sonny...

755
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:52,000
{\an2}当索洛佐跟警察队长勾搭上时
is that while Sollozzo's being guarded like this...

756
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:53,550
{\an2}没人可以碰他了
he is invulnerable.

757
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,330
{\an2}过去从没人胆敢干掉纽约警官
Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain. Never.

758
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,590
{\an2}那会是个大灾难
It would be disastrous.

759
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,500
{\an2}所有五大家族都会追杀你桑尼
All the five families would come after you.

760
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:03,360
{\an2}柯里昂家族会被孤立
The Corleone family would be outcast.

761
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:07,260
{\an2}即使是老头的政治保护都会消失
Even the old man's political protection would run for cover.

762
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,340
{\an2}拜托你
So do me a favor.

763
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:13,260
{\an2}别轻举妄动
Take this into consideration.

764
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,160
{\an2}好吧  我们等
All right, we'll wait.

765
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,540
{\an2}我们不能等
We can't wait.

766
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,270
{\an2}我们不能等
Can't wait.

767
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,850
{\an2}不管索洛佐答应什么 他会杀了爸爸的
I don't care what Sollozzo says about a deal.He's gonna kill Pop. That's it.

768
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,650
{\an2}那是他的关键
That's the key for him.

769
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:35,480
{\an2}必须干掉索洛佐
Got to get Sollozzo.

770
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,480
{\an2}麦克说的对
Mike is right.

771
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,180
{\an2}那个谈判就没有必要了
Let me ask you something first.

772
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:42,120
{\an2}这个麦克劳斯基呢?
What about this McCluskey?

773
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,380
{\an2}我们要拿这个条子怎么办?
What do we do with this cop?

774
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,280
{\an2}他们想与我开会  对吧?
They want to have a meeting with me, right?

775
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:59,020
{\an2}那会是我麦克、劳斯基及索洛佐
It will be me...McCluskey and Sollozzo.

776
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,050
{\an2}我们来安排会议
Let's set the meeting.

777
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,910
{\an2}我们查清楚会议地点在哪里
Get our informers to find out where it's going to be held.

778
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,660
{\an2}必须是公开场所  酒吧或餐厅
We insist it's a public place... a bar, a restaurant.

779
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:18,280
{\an2}人多的地方对我比较安全
Someplace where there's people, so I feel safe.

780
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:23,340
{\an2}我与他们一见面 他们会搜身  对吧?
They're gonna search me when I first meet them, right?

781
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,670
{\an2}那么我身上不能有武器
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

782
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,760
{\an2}若克里曼沙能想出一个办法
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

783
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:34,700
{\an2}能预先把武器放在那
to have a weapon planted there for me...

784
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:41,080
{\an2}那我就能杀了他们两个
then I'll kill them both.

785
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,030
{\an2}你要怎么做?乖乖的大学生
What are you gonna do? Nice college boy, huh?

786
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,810
{\an2}你不是不想和家族中的事 混在一块吗?
Didn't want to get mixed up in the family business.

787
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,610
{\an2}现在因为他打了你 你就想干掉他?
Now you want to gun down a police captain?

788
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,630
{\an2}你以为这里是什么?军队吗?
Why? 'Cause he slapped you in the face a little bit?

789
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,200
{\an2}在一哩以外开枪打他们?
What do you think this is the army, where you shoot them a mile away?

790
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,060
{\an2}你必须离这么近  砰一声
You gotta get up close, like this and...

791
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,100
{\an2}他们的脑浆会溅到你身上
You blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit.

792
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:11,620
{\an2}桑尼… 你太感情用事了
Come here. sonny,You're taking this very personal.

01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:15,090
{\an2}汤姆  这是公事而他却感情用事
Tom, this is business, and this man is taking it very, very personal.

794
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,770
{\an2}谁说不能杀条子的
Where does it say you can't kill a cop?

795
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,820
{\an2}别这样  麦克 汤姆  慢着
- Come on, Mikey. - Tom, wait a minute.

796
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,600
{\an2}他是个跟毒品买卖有关的条子
I'm talking about a cop that's mixed up in drugs.

797
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:25,760
{\an2}他是个不诚实的条子
I'm talking about a dishonest cop,

798
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:29,880
{\an2}和毒贩混在一起终于得到报应
a crooked cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him.

799
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,030
{\an2}那是个好极了的故事
That's a terrific story.

800
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,890
{\an2}报社不是有我们的人吗?
We have newspaper people on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

801
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,320
{\an2}他们也许对那故事有兴趣
They might like a story like that.

802
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:40,610
{\an2}他们也许  只是也许
They might. They just might.

803
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:47,910
{\an2}不是感情用事  桑尼 纯粹是公事
It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.

804
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,120
{\an2}做过表面处理了  追踪不到的
It's as cold as they come.

805
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,640
{\an2}不用担心指纹
Impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints, Mike.

806
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:58,420
{\an2}我在扳机和手把上贴了特殊胶布
I put a special tape on the trigger and the butt.

807
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,490
{\an2}来  试试看

808
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,560
{\an2}怎么了?扳机太紧了?
What's the matter, the trigger too tight?

809
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:18,610
{\an2}我的耳朵好辛苦
- My ears. - I left it noisy.

810
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:23,770
{\an2}我没安装消声器 那样才能吓走旁观的人
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders away.

811
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:25,730
{\an2}好了  你杀了他们两个
All right, you shot them both.

812
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:27,450
{\an2}接下来你怎么办?

813
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,880
{\an2}坐下吃完我的晚餐
Sit down, finish my dinner.

814
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:33,590
{\an2}别开玩笑
Come on, kid. Don't fool around.

815
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,190
{\an2}就让你的手垂下  让枪滑掉
Just let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out.

816
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,360
{\an2}每个人都认为你还拿着枪
Everybody will still think you got it.

817
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:41,530
{\an2}他们会瞪着你的脸  麦克
They're gonna be staring at your face, Mike...

818
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,700
{\an2}所以快步离开那地方但不要跑
so walk out of the place real fast, but you don't run.

819
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:48,050
{\an2}别直视任何人 但也不要看其它地方
Don't look nobody directly in the eye, but don't look away, either.

820
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:52,330
{\an2}他们会怕的不敢瞪你 相信我  不必担心
They're gonna be scared stiff of you, believe me...so don't worry about nothing.

821
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,640
{\an2}你若可以全身而退
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

822
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:58,160
{\an2}可以休个长假到哪里都可以
You take a long vacation, nobody knows where...

823
01:16:58,170 --> 01:16:59,970
{\an2}而我们会处理善后
and we're gonna catch the hell.

824
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:04,570
{\an2}你认为后果会有多糟 他妈的蛮糟的
How bad do you think it's gonna be? Pretty goddamn bad.

825
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,670
{\an2}可能所有的家族会联合对付我们
Probably all the other families will line up against us.

826
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,840
{\an2}那没关系的
That's all right.

827
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:12,270
{\an2}每五年或十年都会发生一次
These things gotta happen every five years or so Ten years.

828

{\an2}害群之马必须要除掉

829

{\an2}上一次到现在已有十年了

830
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,220
{\an2}要先发制人
You gotta stop them at the beginning...

831
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:20,300
{\an2}就像要在慕尼黑制止希特勒一样
like they should have stopped Hitler at Munich.

832
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:24,640
{\an2}他们容忍了希特勒  麻烦就大了
They should have never let him get away with that.They was just asking for big trouble.

833
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,780

{\an2}没有任何线索  什么都没有

{\an2}索洛佐的人也不知在哪里开会

{\an2}我有多少时间
How much time do we have?

839
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:26,070
{\an2}一小时半以后 他们在达西路口接你上车

840
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,790
{\an2}我们派个人追踪他们
We could put a tail on them, see how it turns out.

841
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,060
{\an2}索洛佐会在街上乱转 甩掉我们的人
Sollozzo'll lose our ass going around the block.

842
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,500
{\an2}来找我们谈判的人呢?

843
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,360
{\an2}他在那边和我的手下玩纸牌
He's over at my place playing pinochle with a couple of my men.

844
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:40,080
{\an2}他很高兴  我们在让他赢

845
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,880
{\an2}对麦克太危险了
It's too much of a risk for Mike.

846
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:43,320
{\an2}桑尼  也许我们该取消
Maybe we ought to call it off.

847
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:47,170
{\an2}要麦克平安回来  我们才会让那个人走的
The negotiator keeps playing cards until Mike's back safe and sound.

848
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,340
{\an2}何不干脆干掉车上的人呢?
Why doesn't he blast who's ever in the goddamn car?

849
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,040
{\an2}太危险了  他们会注意的

{\an2}索洛佐也许根本就不在车上

He signed out at that number between 8:00 and 10:00.

864

{\an2}我们或许可把枪用胶带绑在那

{\an2}然后你站起来去上厕所

01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:47,890
你一定要知道一件事

924
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:50,770

925
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:56,060

什么

933
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:35,230
我想说的是...

934
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:43,390
{\an2}对我而言最重要的是

{\an2}闭嘴  去摆桌子吧

971
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:02,760
{\an2}自从麦克劳斯基被杀后
Since McCluskey's killing...

972
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:07,370
{\an2}警方瓦解了我们多数业务

01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:17,520
{\an2}我们反击
so we hit them back.

01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:22,090
{\an2}透过我们报社中的联系 我们提供了不少内幕
Through our contacts in the newspapers... we've been able to put out a lot of material...

978
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:26,030
{\an2}很多麦克劳斯基 跟毒贩索洛佐勾结的事
about McCluskey being linked with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

979
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:29,160
{\an2}所以风声已经没有那么紧了

981
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:37,690
{\an2}在洛杉矶的弗朗西斯科阁下 会给予他保护
under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

982
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:42,930
{\an2}我要他休息一会儿 我要去学赌场的事
I want him to rest. I'm going to learn the casino business.

{\an2}杀索洛佐的是麦克

985
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,850
{\an2}不过他很安全  别担心
But he's safe.

986
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:13,880
{\an2}我们会把他弄回来的
We're starting to work to bring him back now.

987
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:36,850
{\an2}你查出塔托里亚 躲在哪儿没?
I want you to find out where that little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

988
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,290
{\an2}我要他的命  现在
I want his ass now... right now.

989
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,990
{\an2}听我说  桑尼 什么事?

990
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,770
{\an2}现在局势才刚刚缓和下来
Things are starting to loosen up a little bit.

991
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,320
{\an2}你若去追塔托里亚
If you go after Tattaglia,

992
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,580
{\an2}又会引起一场大战的
all hell's going to break loose.

993
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:47,280
{\an2}等事情平静一点让爸爸去协调
Let the smoke clear. Pop can negotiate.

994
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:49,050
{\an2}不  爸爸在身体好转之前 什么都不能做
No, Pop can't do nothing till he's better.

995
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,060
{\an2}我要决定什么对我们最有利
I'm gonna decide...

996
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:52,060
{\an2}好的  可是你那场火并 使我们损失很多
All right, but your war's costing us a lot of money.

997
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:53,660
{\an2}没有任何进帐  我们不能做事
Nothing's coming in. We can't do business.

998
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:56,640
{\an2}他们也不行  别担心
Neither can they. Don't worry about it.

999
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:58,650
{\an2}他们没有我们损失那么大 请你别担心这点
-We can't afford a stalemate.No more stalemate.

1000
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,470
{\an2}我会以宰了那老混蛋来做结束
I'm gonna end it by killing that old bastard.

1001

You're getting a great reputation. I hope you're enjoying it.

{\an2}依照我叫你做的去做
Do what I tell you to do!

1003
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,590
{\an2}该死的  我若有个西西里人 来当我的战略军师
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime consigliere... a Sicilian...

1004
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,510
{\an2}我就不会落到这种地步了
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1005
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,880
{\an2}爸爸有杰安可  看看我有什么?
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1006
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:17,010
{\an2}对不起  我不是有意的
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1007
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,610
{\an2}妈妈煮了晚餐  今天是星期天
Mom made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

1008

Niggers are having a good time... with our policy banks up there in Harlem.

1009
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:30,120

Driving them new Cadillacs, paying 50? on a bet.

1010
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:33,590
{\an2}从他们开始赚钱时 我就知道这会发生
I knew that was gonna happen as soon as they started making big money.

1011
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:37,550
{\an2}爸爸从来不在餐桌上 当着孩子们谈他的公事
Papa never talked business at the table in front of the kids.

1012
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:42,070
{\an2}闭嘴  康妮… 不准你叫她闭嘴  知道吗?
-Shut up, Connie. -Don't you ever tell her to shut up. You got that?

1013
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,220
{\an2}别干预
Santino, don't interfere.

1014
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,400
{\an2}桑尼、汤姆 吃过饭后  我想与你们谈谈
Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk to you, maybe after dinner.

I could be doing more for the family. We don't discuss business at the table.

我向你致敬  汤玛西诺阁下

1017
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:47,220
麦克

1018
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,700
你为何离房子那么远?

1019
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:53,350
你可知万一你出了事 我要向令尊负责的

1020
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,210
保镖们都在这

1021
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,820
还是十分危险

1022
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:01,350
我听纽约的桑提诺说的

1023
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:04,160
你的敌人知道你在这了

1024
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:07,770
桑提诺有没有说我何时能回去?

1025
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:09,590
还不行

1026
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,010
目前是不可能的

1027
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,410
谢谢

1028
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,220

柯里昂村

1030
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:21,960
坐我的车去

1031
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,070
我想走路

1032
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:30,020

01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:52,080
麦克  柯里昂村到了

1034
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:05,510
所有的男人都到哪去了?

1035
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,060
他们全都在战争中死了

1036
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:12,980
这里是死者的姓名

1037
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:03,590
我的老天  好一个美女

1038
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:14,840
你好像中邪了一样

1039
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:20,800
麦克

1040
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:24,950
在西西里  女人比猎枪还危险

1041
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,930
打猎有收收获吗?

1042
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:55,320
你认识这一带所有的女孩吗?

1043
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:59,120
我们看到几位真正的美人

1044
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:06,170
其中一位让我们的朋友触电了

1045
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:08,600
她可真够骚了

1046
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:13,060
她全身上下都很美

1047
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:23,260
那么漂亮的头发、嘴

1048
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:27,270
这一带的女孩都很美 而且很贞洁

1049
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,000
这个穿着紫色衣服

1050
01:41:30,010 --> 01:41:32,730
头发上绑着紫色的缎带

1051
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:38,900
看起来像希腊人而非意大利人

1052
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:41,720
你认识她吗?

1053
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:44,360
不认识

1054
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:49,090
在本镇没有那样子的女孩

1055
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,740
我的天  我明白了

1056
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,690
有什么不对了?

1057
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,600

1068
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:09,190
{\an2}但那样令媛会失去父亲
But then your daughter would lose a father...

1069
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:13,460
{\an2}而不是得到一位丈夫

1070
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:23,740
{\an2}我想认识你女儿
I want to meet your daughter...

02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:23,350
{\an2}他却拒绝与我们分享
He refused to share them.

1248
02:08:23,850 --> 02:08:27,750
{\an2}我何时拒绝过与大家分享
When did I ever refuse an accommodation?

1249
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:29,770
{\an2}在座的全都认识我
All of you know me here.

1250
02:08:31,190 --> 02:08:34,820
{\an2}除了一次以外  我何时拒绝过?
When did I ever refuse, except one time?

1251
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:37,200
{\an2}你们知道为什么
And why?

1252
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:43,280
{\an2}因为我相信毒品生意 在往后几年会毁了我们
Because I believe this drug business...is gonna destroy us in the years to come.

1253
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:48,110
{\an2}这不像赌、酒和女人
I mean, it's not like gambling or liquor or even women...

1254
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:51,140
{\an2}这些是人们想要的东西
which is something that most people want nowadays

1255
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:54,140
{\an2}只是教会不准我们做而己
and is forbidden to them by the pezzonovante of the church.

1256
02:08:54,150 --> 02:08:58,960
{\an2}即使警察过去在赌博等方面愿意协助我们
Even the police departments that have helped us in the past with gambling and other things

1257
02:08:58,970 --> 02:09:02,720
{\an2}但一提到毒品 他们会拒绝帮忙
are gonna refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics.

1258
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:08,690
{\an2}我以前那么想 现在想法依然不变
And I believed that then... and I believe that now.

1259
02:09:08,700 --> 02:09:10,630
{\an2}时代变了
Times have changed.

1260
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:13,070
{\an2}不像昔日了
It's not like the old days...

1261
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:15,400
{\an2}我们能做任何我们想做的事
when we could do anything we want.

1262
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:18,230
{\an2}你拒绝合作实在不够朋友
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1263
02:09:18,590 --> 02:09:22,660
{\an2}柯里昂阁下握有全纽约 法律界以及政客的势力
If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians in New York...

1264
02:09:22,670 --> 02:09:25,740
{\an2}他就必须与大家分享  让大家都能利用他们
then he must share them or let others use them.

1265
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:29,380
{\an2}他必须让我们分汲利益 大家一起发财
He must let us draw the water from the well.

1266
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:33,460
{\an2}当然他能因这种服务 而向大家收费
Certainly, he can present a bill for such services.

1267
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:36,930
{\an2}毕竟我们不是共产党
After all, we are not Communists.

1268
02:09:39,340 --> 02:09:41,800
{\an2}我同样的也不相信毒品
I also don't believe in drugs.

1269
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:44,840
{\an2}多年来我付手下优厚的待遇
For years, I paid my people extra...

1270
02:09:44,850 --> 02:09:47,440
{\an2}使他们不去沾毒品
so they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1271
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:50,360
{\an2}避免有人来找他们 并且说我有白粉
Somebody comes to them and says, ''I have powders.

1272
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:53,900
{\an2}你只要投资三千元到四千元
If you put up a three, four-thousand-dollar investment...

1273
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:57,330
{\an2}就可以赚到五万元
we can make 50,000 distributing.''

1274
02:09:58,010 --> 02:09:59,640
{\an2}他们怎能抗拒得了
So they can't resist.

1275
02:09:59,650 --> 02:10:04,420
{\an2}我想以正派的方法 来经营毒品生意
I want to control it as a business...to keep it respectable.

1276
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:06,150
{\an2}我不要它们接近学校
I don't want it near schools.

1277
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:08,480
{\an2}我不要把它们卖给孩子
I don't want it sold to children.

1278
02:10:09,110 --> 02:10:11,310
{\an2}那是残害幼苗
That's an infamia.

1279
02:10:12,150 --> 02:10:16,050
{\an2}我只想卖给那些黑人 或是在有色人种中流通
In my city, we'll keep the traffic in the dark people, the colored.

1280
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:19,870
{\an2}他们反正是动物 所以让他们去堕落吧
They're animals anyway, so let them lose their souls.

1281
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:29,980
{\an2}我本希望能合理的讨论一些事
I hoped that we could come here and reason together.

1282
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:32,050
{\an2}身为一个讲道理的人
As a reasonable man

1283
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:38,190
{\an2}我愿意为此事找个和平解决之道
I'm willing to do whatever's necessary to find a peaceful solution to these problems.

1284
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:39,620
{\an2}那么我们全都达成协议
Then we are agreed.

1285
02:10:39,630 --> 02:10:42,660
{\an2}毒品生意可以做但要有限制
The traffic in drugs will be permitted but controlled.

1286
02:10:42,670 --> 02:10:45,690
{\an2}柯里昂阁下会给我们东部的保护
Don Corleone will give us protection in the east...

1287
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:47,350
{\an2}然后我们和平相处
and there will be the peace.

1288
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:50,820
{\an2}但我必须有柯里昂阁下的 确切保证
But I must have strict assurance from Corleone.

1289
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:54,390
{\an2}万一他的地位越来越坚固之后
As time goes by and his position becomes stronger...

1290
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:56,950
{\an2}他是否会采取复仇行动
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1291
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:59,120
{\an2}听着我们这全是讲理的人
Look, we are all reasonable men here.

1292
02:10:59,130 --> 02:11:02,360
{\an2}我们不需像是律师般 给什么确切保证
We don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers.

1293
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:04,830
{\an2}你谈到复仇
You talk about vengeance.

1294
02:11:05,250 --> 02:11:08,480
{\an2}复仇会让你的儿子复活吗?
Is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you?

1295
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:10,870
{\an2}或者我的儿子?
Or my boy to me?

1296
02:11:11,190 --> 02:11:14,560
{\an2}我不会再去计较我儿子的死
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1297
02:11:16,830 --> 02:11:19,760
{\an2}但我有个自私的要求
But I have selfish reasons.

1298
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:26,190
{\an2}我的小儿子被迫离开这个国家
My youngest son...was forced to leave this country...

1299
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:29,620
{\an2}全都因为这索洛佐的事
because of this Sollozzo business.

1300
02:11:30,030 --> 02:11:35,010
{\an2}我必须安排让他安全的回来
All right. And I have to make arrangements...

1301
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:37,950
{\an2}洗脱种种无中生有的罪名
to bring him back here safely, cleared of all these false charges.

1302
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:41,980
{\an2}而我是个迷信的人
But I'm a superstitious man.

1303
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:44,260
{\an2}若是他不幸发生意外
And if some unlucky accident should befall him...

1304
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:48,500
{\an2}或被警察开枪打死
if he should get shot in the head by a police officer...

1305
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:52,810
{\an2}或在牢里上吊
or if he should hang himself in his jail cell...

1306
02:11:52,820 --> 02:11:56,090
{\an2}或是他被闪电击中
of if he's struck by a bolt of lightening...

1307
02:11:56,850 --> 02:12:00,570
{\an2}那我会怪罪于在这房间内的诸位
then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room.

1308
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:04,910
{\an2}到那时候我就不会再客气了
And that I do not forgive.

1309
02:12:06,970 --> 02:12:09,860
{\an2}但除了那个以外
But that aside...

1310
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:19,060
{\an2}我以我孙子的性命发誓
let me say that I swear... on the souls of my grandchildren...

1311
02:12:19,690 --> 02:12:23,910
{\an2}我不会是打破我们今天和议的人
that I will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today.

1312
02:12:49,420 --> 02:12:51,410
{\an2}当我见塔托里亚的人时
When I meet with the Tattaglia people, should I insist...

1313
02:12:51,420 --> 02:12:54,780
{\an2}应否坚持那些毒品中间人 都没有前科?
that all these drug middlemen have clean records?

1314
02:12:55,060 --> 02:12:57,430
{\an2}提出来无妨  不要坚持
Mention it. Don't insist.

1315
02:12:59,230 --> 02:13:02,590
{\an2}巴西尼这种人你不说他也明白
Barzini is a man who'll know that without being told.

1316
02:13:03,130 --> 02:13:04,810
{\an2}你是说塔托里亚
You mean Tattaglia.

1317
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:08,190
{\an2}塔托里亚是个下三滥?
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1318
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:11,970
{\an2}他根本没本事干掉桑提诺
He never could've outfought Santino.

1319
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:17,750
{\an2}我在今天以前并不晓得
But I didn't know until this day that it was...

1320
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:20,660
{\an2}一直是巴西尼在主使
Barzini all along.

1321
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:37,410
{\an2}来吧  南希
Come on, Nancy.

1322
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:41,750
{\an2}大家紧跟在一起  布莱恩
Keep together, everyone. Brian?

1323
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:44,580
{\an2}好的…
All right.

1324
02:13:57,570 --> 02:13:59,500
{\an2}你回来多久了?
How long have you been back?

1325
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:02,020
{\an2}一年了
I've been back a year.

1326
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:05,490
{\an2}也许还不止
Longer than that, I think.

1327
02:14:08,330 --> 02:14:10,530
{\an2}见到你真好  凯
It's good to see you, Kay.

1328
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:24,030
{\an2}我现在为我父亲做事
I'm working for my father now.

1329
02:14:26,830 --> 02:14:30,230
{\an2}他病了  病的很重
He's been sick.Very sick.

1330
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:33,370
{\an2}但是你不像他  麦克
But you're not like him.

1331
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:35,980
{\an2}我以为你不会成为令尊那样的人
I thought you weren't going to become a man like your father.

1332
02:14:35,990 --> 02:14:37,830
{\an2}那是你所告诉我的
That's what you told me.

1333
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:42,470
{\an2}家父与其它有权的人一样
My father's no different than any other powerful man.

1334
02:14:43,540 --> 02:14:47,680
{\an2}就是那种要对其他人负责任的人
Any man who's responsible for other people.

1335
02:14:48,050 --> 02:14:50,430
{\an2}像是参议员或是总统
Like a senator or a president.

1336
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:52,130
{\an2}你知道你说这些话有多天真
Do you know how naive you sound?

1337
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:53,300
{\an2}为什么?
Why?

1338
02:14:53,310 --> 02:14:56,500
{\an2}参议员及总统不杀人
Senators and presidents don't have men killed.

1339
02:14:59,210 --> 02:15:01,320
{\an2}是谁天真?凯
Who's being naive?Kay

1340
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:05,760
{\an2}家父做事的那一套己过时了
My father's way of doing things is over.

1341
02:15:05,770 --> 02:15:07,660
{\an2}连他都晓得那一点
It's finished. Even he knows that.

1342
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:09,620
{\an2}我是说在五年之内
I mean, in five years the Corleone family...

1343
02:15:09,630 --> 02:15:12,780
{\an2}柯里昂家族会完全合法化
is going to be completely legitimate.

1344
02:15:14,180 --> 02:15:15,260
{\an2}相信我
Trust me.

1345
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:17,600
{\an2}我很清楚我未来的走向
That's all I can tell you about my business.

1346
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:19,120
{\an2}凯
Kay

1347
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:22,200
{\an2}麦克  你为何到这来?
Michael,Why did you come here?

1348
02:15:22,210 --> 02:15:23,800
{\an2}为什么?
Why?

1349
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:25,890
{\an2}你究竟想要我怎么样
What do you want with me after all this time...

1350
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:29,370
{\an2}这么多年来 你不打电话也不写信
without even calling or writing?

1351
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:32,630
{\an2}我来这是因为我需要你 我关心你
I came here because I need you.

1352
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:33,890
{\an2}别再说了  麦克
- Because I care for you. - Please stop it.

1353
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:37,430
{\an2}因为我要你嫁给我
Because I want you to marry me.

1354
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:39,750
{\an2}太迟了…
- It's too late. - Please.

1355
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:41,950
{\an2}凯…
Kay

1356
02:15:42,530 --> 02:15:47,200
{\an2}我会做任何事 以弥补过去所发生的事
I'll do anything you ask to make up for what's happened to us.

1357
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:50,680
{\an2}因为那很重要  凯
Because that's important.Kay

1358
02:15:50,690 --> 02:15:53,400
{\an2}重要的是因为…
Because what's important is that...

1359
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:56,010
{\an2}我们拥有彼此
we have each other.

1360
02:15:56,030 --> 02:15:58,180
{\an2}而且我们要共度一生
That we have a life together.

1361
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:00,660
{\an2}我们会有孩子
That we have children...

1362
02:16:00,670 --> 02:16:02,660
{\an2}我们的孩子
our children.

1363
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:04,480
{\an2}凯
Kay

1364
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:06,820
{\an2}我需要你
I need you...

1365
02:16:07,190 --> 02:16:09,430
{\an2}而且我爱你
and I love you.

1366
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:33,220
{\an2}巴西尼的人抢我们的地盘
Barzini's people chisel my territory...

1367
02:16:33,230 --> 02:16:34,950
{\an2}而我们却无能为力
and we do nothing about it.

1368
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:37,820
{\an2}再过不久布鲁克林 我连落脚的地方都没有了
Soon, there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1369
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:38,910
{\an2}有耐性点
-Just be patient.

1370
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:41,910
{\an2}我不是求你帮忙 只是不想受制肘
I'm not askin' you for help. Just take off the handcuffs.

1371
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:43,120
{\an2}再忍耐点
Be patient.

1372
02:16:43,130 --> 02:16:45,030
{\an2}我们必须保护自己
We gotta protect ourselves.

1373
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:47,070
{\an2}给我个机会再培养一些新人
Give me a chance to recruit some new men.

1374
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:48,540
{\an2}不
No.

1375
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:53,040
{\an2}我不要给巴西尼借口来开战 麦克  你错了
-I don't wanna give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.-Mike, you're wrong.

1376
02:16:54,110 --> 02:16:55,650
{\an2}柯里昂阁下
Don Corleone,

1377
02:16:56,280 --> 02:17:00,390
{\an2}你曾说过要让我与泰西欧 自立门户
you once said the day would come when Tessio and me could form our own family.

1378
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:02,390
{\an2}今天以前我想都不敢想
Till today, I would never think of it.

1379
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:04,500
{\an2}但现在我要求你的批准
I must ask your permission.

1380
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:08,630
{\an2}现在由麦克当家
Well, Michael is now head of the family and

1381
02:17:08,630 --> 02:17:11,630
{\an2}如果他答应我就祝福你
if he gives his permission, then you have my blessing.

1382
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:14,930
{\an2}等我们搬到内华达州后
After we make the move to Nevada...

1383
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:18,090
{\an2}你就可由柯里昂家族分出 自立门户
you can break off from the Corleone family and go on your own.

1384
02:17:18,330 --> 02:17:19,750
{\an2}但得在我们搬到内华达州之后
- After we make the move to Nevada.

1385
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:21,310
{\an2}那得花多少时间?

1386
02:17:22,590 --> 02:17:24,140
{\an2}六个月

1387
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:25,440
{\an2}原谅我  教父
Forgive me, Godfather,

1388
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:27,180
{\an2}但当你走了后

1389
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:30,480
{\an2}我与彼得迟早会成为巴西尼的靶
me and Pete'll come under Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

1390
02:17:30,490 --> 02:17:32,290
{\an2}我恨那该死的巴西尼
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1391
02:17:32,300 --> 02:17:35,670
{\an2}六个月之后 我们已经搞不出什么玩意了
In six months' time, there won't be nothing left to build on.

1392
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:38,290
{\an2}你对我的判断有信心吗?
You have faith in my judgment?

1393
02:17:38,300 --> 02:17:39,410
{\an2}是的
Yes.

1394
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:40,540
{\an2}你仍对我忠心吗?
Do I have your loyalty?

1395
02:17:40,550 --> 02:17:42,150
{\an2}是的  忠心不二  教父
Always, Godfather.

1396
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:44,300
{\an2}那么就当麦克的朋友吧
Then be a friend to Michael...

1397
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:46,440
{\an2}照他所说的去做
and do as he says.

1398
02:17:50,330 --> 02:17:51,920
{\an2}现在有些事仍在磋商
There are things being negotiated that are gonna solve...

1399
02:17:51,930 --> 02:17:55,510
{\an2}你们的问题和困难 全都可以得到解决
all your problems and answer all your questions.

1400
02:17:55,670 --> 02:17:57,770
{\an2}目前我只能这么说
That's all I can tell you now.

1401
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:01,200
{\an2}卡洛  你在内华达长大的

1402
02:18:01,430 --> 02:18:04,450
{\an2}当我们搬的时候 你会是我的左右手
When we make our move there, you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1403
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:07,320
{\an2}汤姆哈根不再做军师了
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1404
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:09,790
{\an2}他将会担任 我们在拉斯维加斯的律师
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1405
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:12,530
{\an2}我对汤姆没有不满 但我不要他再当军师
That's no reflection on Tom, but that's the way I want it.

1406
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:16,650
{\an2}况且有我父亲在 他可以做我最佳的军师
Besides, if I ever need help... who's a better consigliere than my father?

1407
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,340
{\an2}就是这样了
That's it.

1408
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:39,830
{\an2}谢谢  爸爸 我为你高兴  卡洛
- Thank you, Papa. - I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1409
02:18:41,330 --> 02:18:44,600
{\an2}麦克  我为何出局了?
Why am I out?

1410
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:48,470
{\an2}你不适合当乱局中的军师
You're not a wartime consigliere.

1411
02:18:49,530 --> 02:18:52,950
{\an2}我们一搬到内华达后 事情会变得更棘手
Things may get rough with the move we're trying.

1412
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:54,720
{\an2}汤姆
Tom

1413
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:01,590
{\an2}我向麦克建议过
I advised Michael.

1414
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:04,620
{\an2}我从未认为你不适合当军师
I never thought you were a bad consigliere.

1415
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:07,930
{\an2}我认为桑提诺不适合当家
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

1416
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:09,830
{\an2}愿他安息
rest in peace.

1417
02:19:10,190 --> 02:19:13,900
{\an2}我信任麦克和你一样
Michael has all my confidence, as you do.

1418
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:15,910
{\an2}但是…
But

1419
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:20,420
{\an2}不让你参与往后的行动 是有理由的
there are reasons why you must have no part of what is going to happen.

1420
02:19:20,430 --> 02:19:22,160
{\an2}我多少能帮得上忙
Maybe I could help.

1421
02:19:22,170 --> 02:19:23,930
{\an2}用不着了  汤姆
You're out,Tom

1422
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:15,560
{\an2}我实在无法不去注意你的脸
I can't get over the way your face looks.

1423

{\an2}它的确看起来很棒
It really looks good.

1424
02:20:17,090 --> 02:20:18,850
{\an2}这位医生的工夫确实不错
This doctor did some job.

1425
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:20,160
{\an2}是凯说服你去的吗?
Who talked you into it, Kay?

1426
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:22,720
{\an2}慢着  把它们留下这
Hey, hey, wait. Leave them out here.

1427
02:20:22,730 --> 02:20:23,930
{\an2}我们待会再处理它们
We'll deal with them later.

1428
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:25,450
{\an2}他累了  他想梳洗一下
He's tired. He wants to clean up.

1429
02:20:25,460 --> 02:20:27,790
{\an2}好了  让我来开门  好吗?

1506
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:07,440
{\an2}因为海岸的莫伦纳家族
